**Description:**

Write a function `solution` that, given an integer N, returns the smallest non-negative integer whose individual digits sum to N.

**Examples:**

1. Given N = 16, the function should return 79. There are many numbers whose digits sum to 16 (for example: 79, 97, 808, 5551, 22822, etc.). The smallest such number is 79.
2. Given N = 19, the function should return 199 (the sum of digits is 1 + 9 + 9 = 19).
3. Given N = 7, the function should return 7.

**Assumptions:**
- N is an integer within the range [0..50].
- Focus on correctness; performance is not the primary concern.
