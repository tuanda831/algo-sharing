# Task description

Write a function:
```c
String solution(String S, String T)
```

that, given two strings S and T consisting of N and M characters, respectively, determines whether string T can be obtained from string S by at most one simple operation from the set specified below. The function should return a string:

- "**INSERT** c" if string T can be obtained from string S by inserting a single character 'c' at the beginning of the string.
- "**REMOVE** c" if string T can be obtained from string S by deleting a single character 'c' from the end of the string.
- "**SWAP** c d" if string T can be obtained from string S by swapping two adjacent characters "c" and "d". The two characters should be distinct and in the same order as in string S; exactly one swap is performed).
• **"EQUAL"** if no operation is needed (strings T and S are equal).
• **"IMPOSSIBLE"** if none of the above works.

Note that by characters 'c' and 'd' from the operations above, we mean any English alphabet lowercase letters.

**For example:**
- given S = "gain" and T = "again", the function should return "INSERT a";
- given S = "parks" and T = "park", the function should return "REMOVE s";
- given S = "form" and T = "from", the function should return "SWAP o r";
- given S = "o" and T = "odd", the function should return "IMPOSSIBLE";
- given S = "fift" and T = "fifth", the function should return "IMPOSSIBLE".

**Assume that:**
• N and M are integers within the range [1, 100];
• strings S and T are made only of lowercase letters (a-z).

In your solution, focus on correctness. The performance of your solution will not be the focus of the assessment.
