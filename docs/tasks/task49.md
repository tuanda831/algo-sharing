# Task description

You are given a task to fix potholes in a road. The road is described by a string S consisting of N characters. Each character represents a single fragment of the road. Character '.' denotes a smooth surface and 'x' denotes a pothole. For example, S = "...xxx.x" means that the road starts with three smooth fragments, followed by three potholes, followed by two smooth fragments and ending with one pothole.

You can choose any number of consecutive potholes and fix all of them. Fixing a segment consisting of K consecutive potholes costs K + 1. In the example above, fixing the first two consecutive potholes costs 2 + 1 = 3 and fixing the last pothole costs 1 + 1 = 2. After these fixes, the road would look like this: "......." and the total cost is 5.

You are given a budget B. You can fix multiple segments containing potholes as long as you fit in the budget. What is the maximum number of potholes you can fix?

Write a function:

```
int solution(char *S, int B);
```

that, given the string S of length N and the integer B, returns the maximum number of potholes that can be fixed.

## Examples:

1. Given S = "...xxx..x....xxx." and B = 7, the function should return 5. You can start by fixing the first three consecutive potholes for a cost of 4, obtaining the road "........x....xxx.". Then, you can fix the last two potholes for a cost of 3, obtaining the road "........x....x...". The total cost is 7, which fits in the budget, and you fix 5 potholes in total.

2. Given S = "..xxxxx" and B = 4, the function should return 3. One way is to fix the first 3 potholes in the middle stretch which costs the whole budget and yields the road ".....xx". Alternatively, you could fix the middle 3 potholes or the last three potholes.

3. Given S = "x.x.xxx...x" and B = 14, the function should return 6. You can fix all the potholes, which costs 2 + 2 + 4 + 2 = 10, leaving you with the spare budget of 4. This fixes the entire road.

4. Given S = ".." and B = 5, the function should return 0. There are no potholes to fix.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

• N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
• B is an integer within the range [0..200,000];
• string S consists only of characters '.' and 'x'.
